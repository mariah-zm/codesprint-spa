# inquizit-spa

This is a Single-Page Application built with Angular using SCSS and Bootstrap. The web application was built for the 2022 edition of the coding competition [CodeSprint](https://codesprintmalta.edu.mt/) in which I placed [second](https://codesprintmalta.edu.mt/code-spint-2022/) in the Undergraduate category. The task booklet can be found [here](https://codesprintmalta.edu.mt/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undergrad_Task_2022.pdf).

The Backend of the web app can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/mariah-zm/codesprint-be).
