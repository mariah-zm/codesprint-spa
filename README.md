# codesprint-spa

This is a Single-Page Application built with Angular using SCSS and Bootstrap. The web app was built for the 2022 edition of the coding competition [CodeSprint](https://codesprintmalta.edu.mt/) in which I placed [second](https://codesprintmalta.edu.mt/code-spint-2022/) in the Undergraduate category. 

The competition required participants to build a web application that allows registered teachers to create quizzes for their students. Students are also required to register to access and attempt these quizzes. The task booklet containing the detailed requirements can be found [here](https://codesprintmalta.edu.mt/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Undergrad_Task_2022.pdf).

The Backend of the web app can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/mariah-zm/codesprint-be).
